## ✅ Successfully Completed Tests

### 1. Database Cleanup ✅
- **Test**: Clear all collections (Users, Customers, Tasks, Subtasks, Activities, TaskRequests)
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED
- **Details**: All collections cleared successfully, database ready for new structure

### 2. User Creation and Authentication ✅
- **Test**: Create users for all roles (PM, Employee, Customer) with proper validation
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED (6/6 tests)
- **Details**: 
  - ✅ PM user created with required fields (department, jobTitle, workTitle)
  - ✅ Employee user created with required fields
  - ✅ Customer user created with required field (company)
  - ✅ All users can login successfully
  - ✅ JWT tokens generated correctly
  - ✅ Authentication working for all roles

### 3. Customer Management ✅
- **Test**: Complete CRUD operations for Customer entity
- **Result**: ✅ PASSED (4/4 tests)
- **Details**:
  - ✅ Customer creation with team assignment
  - ✅ Customer retrieval with proper response structure
  - ✅ Customer update functionality
  - ✅ Customer statistics retrieval

## 🚧 Partially Completed Tests

### 4. Task Management 🚧
- **Test**: Complete CRUD operations for Task entity
- **Result**: 🚧 PARTIAL (2/4 tests passed)
- **Details**:
  - ✅ Task creation successful
  - ✅ Task retrieval working with correct response structure
  - ❌ Task update failing with internal server error
  - ❌ Task status update by employee failing with validation error

## ❌ Failed Tests

### 5. Subtask Management ❌
- **Test**: Complete CRUD operations for Subtask entity
- **Result**: ❌ FAILED (0/2 tests)
- **Details**:
  - ❌ Subtask creation failing: "Task not found or does not belong to the specified customer"
  - ❌ Subtask retrieval failing due to no subtasks created

## 🔧 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Server Crash Issue ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Server crashing due to missing Project/Milestone models in taskRequestController
- **Solution**: Updated taskRequestController to use Customer and Task models instead
- **Impact**: Server now starts successfully

### 2. Activity Model Compatibility ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Activity model still expecting old Project structure
- **Solution**: Updated Activity model to support Customer structure:
  - Changed activity types from project/milestone to customer/task/subtask
  - Updated targetModel enum to include Customer, Task, Subtask
  - Changed project field to customer field
- **Impact**: Customer creation now works with activity logging

### 3. Response Structure Mismatch ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Test script expecting different response structure than API returns
- **Solution**: Updated test script to match actual API response structure:
  - Customer retrieval: `data.customers` instead of `data`
  - Task retrieval: `data.tasks` instead of `data`
- **Impact**: Customer and task retrieval tests now pass

## 🚨 Current Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. Task Update Internal Server Error
- **Issue**: Task update endpoint returning 500 internal server error
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/tasks/:taskId/customer/:customerId`
- **Status**: Needs investigation
- **Priority**: High

### 2. Task Status Update Validation Error
- **Issue**: Employee task status update failing validation
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/employee/tasks/:id/status`
- **Status**: Needs investigation
- **Priority**: High

### 3. Subtask Creation Failure
- **Issue**: Subtask creation failing with "Task not found" error
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/subtasks`
- **Status**: Needs investigation
- **Priority**: High

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETE
- Database cleanup and model updates
- User management system
- Basic authentication

### Phase 2: Core Entities 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- Customer management ✅ Complete
- Task management 🚧 Partial (50% complete)
- Subtask management ❌ Not started

### Phase 3: Advanced Features ⏳ PENDING
- Progress tracking
- File management
- Activity tracking
- Permissions and security
- Search and filtering
- Data validation
- Error handling

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Investigate Task Update Error**: Check server logs and task controller for issues
2. **Fix Task Status Validation**: Review validation middleware and employee controller
3. **Debug Subtask Creation**: Verify task-customer relationship and subtask controller
4. **Complete Remaining Tests**: Progress tracking, file management, etc.

### Testing Strategy:
1. Fix current failing tests before proceeding
2. Complete all CRUD operations for all entities
3. Test integration between entities (customer → task → subtask)
4. Validate progress calculation and real-time updates
5. Test file upload/download functionality
6. Verify role-based permissions and security

## 🏆 Key Achievements
