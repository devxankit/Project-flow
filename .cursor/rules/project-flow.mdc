description: All new pages and components must be designed and implemented with a mobile-first approach and follow the centralized theme system. 
  Mobile responsiveness is the top priority: layouts, typography, spacing, and interactions must look and work perfectly on small screens before considering desktop or larger breakpoints.
  Desktop and tablet layouts are secondary and should only be enhanced after the mobile experience is fully ensured.
  Use responsive CSS utilities (e.g., Tailwind's mobile-first classes) and test all UI on a variety of mobile devices and screen sizes.
  Do not assume any minimum desktop width; always start with the smallest supported screen.
  All breakpoints and media queries must enhance the mobile layout, not replace it.
  
  THEME CONSISTENCY: All new components and pages must use the centralized theme colors defined in src/config/theme.js.
  Use theme classes like bg-primary, text-primary, border-primary, bg-primary-hover, bg-primary-light, bg-primary-dark instead of hardcoded colors.
  Never use hardcoded hex colors, purple-*, blue-*, or other color variants - always use the theme system.
  This ensures consistent branding and makes it easy to change the entire website's color scheme from one central location.
  
  This rule applies to all new pages, components, and UI elements in the project.
