  1. All pages and components must use the project's centralized color theme. Use theme variables or utility classes for colors, backgrounds, and gradients. Do not hardcode color values.
  2. Every new page and component must be fully responsive, with a mobile-first layout as the default. Design for small screens first, then enhance for tablets and desktops.
  3. The website should look and function like a mobile app on mobile devices, with navigation and UI optimized for touch and small screens.
  4. Desktop and larger screen layouts must be visually appealing and make good use of available space, but mobile experience is the priority.
  5. Use CSS variables, Tailwind classes, or theme utilities for all color and spacing decisions.
  6. Test all new UI on both mobile and desktop breakpoints before merging.
  7. Do not introduce any new color, font, or spacing outside the theme configuration.
  8. Navigation and interactive elements must be easily accessible and usable on mobile devices.
  9. Document any new componentâ€™s responsive behavior and color usage in its code comments.
