# Mobile Login Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "Network error. Please check your connection." on Mobile Devices

### ‚úÖ What I've Fixed

1. **Completely Rewritten CORS Configuration**
   - Replaced complex cors middleware with simple, reliable manual CORS headers
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Simplified preflight request handling

2. **Updated Backend Configuration**
   - Added all possible Vercel frontend URLs to allowed origins
   - Enabled credentials support for authentication
   - Added proper headers for mobile browsers

3. **Deployed Changes**
   - Committed and pushed the new CORS configuration
   - Render is now deploying the updated backend

### üîç How to Verify the Fix

#### Step 1: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)
Render should automatically deploy the changes. You can check the deployment status in your Render dashboard.

#### Step 2: Check Backend Logs
In your Render dashboard, look for these log messages:
```
üöÄ Server starting with CORS origins: [ 'https://project-flow-gilt.vercel.app', ... ]
üì° Request from origin: https://project-flow-gilt.vercel.app
‚úÖ CORS allowed for origin: https://project-flow-gilt.vercel.app
```

#### Step 3: Test on Mobile
1. Open your Vercel frontend on your mobile device
2. Try to login
3. Check if the "Network error" message is gone

### üö® If Issue Persists

#### Check 1: Verify Backend URL
Make sure your frontend is using the correct backend URL:
- Frontend should connect to: `https://project-flow-hyas.onrender.com/api`
- Check browser developer tools (if available on mobile) for the actual request URL

#### Check 2: Network Connectivity
Test if your mobile device can reach the backend:
- Try opening `https://project-flow-hyas.onrender.com/api/health` in your mobile browser
- Should return: `{"status":"success","message":"Server is running",...}`

#### Check 3: Browser Developer Tools
If you can access developer tools on mobile:
1. Open Network tab
2. Try to login
3. Look for failed requests to the backend
4. Check for CORS errors in the console

#### Check 4: Alternative Testing
Try these alternative approaches:
1. **Different Browser**: Test in Chrome, Safari, Firefox on mobile
2. **Incognito Mode**: Test in private/incognito browsing
3. **Different Network**: Try on WiFi vs mobile data
4. **Clear Cache**: Clear browser cache and cookies

### üîß Additional Debugging

#### Backend Logs to Check
Look for these in Render logs:
- `‚ùå CORS blocked origin:` - indicates origin is not in allowed list
- `üì° Request from origin: undefined` - indicates no origin header (mobile app)
- `‚úÖ CORS allowed for origin:` - indicates successful CORS

#### Frontend Configuration
Verify in `frontend/src/utils/api.js`:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'https://project-flow-hyas.onrender.com/api';
```

### üì± Mobile-Specific Considerations

1. **iOS Safari**: Sometimes has stricter CORS policies
2. **Android Chrome**: Generally more permissive
3. **Mobile Data**: Some mobile carriers block certain requests
4. **App vs Browser**: Different behavior in mobile apps vs mobile browsers

### üÜò If Still Not Working

If the issue persists after the deployment:

1. **Check Render Logs**: Look for any error messages during deployment
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Make sure `FRONTEND_URL` is set in Render
3. **Test with Postman**: Use Postman to test the backend directly from your mobile device
4. **Contact Support**: The issue might be with Render's infrastructure or your mobile carrier

### üìû Quick Test Commands

Test backend connectivity from your computer:
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://project-flow-hyas.onrender.com/api/health

# Test CORS with origin header
curl -H "Origin: https://project-flow-gilt.vercel.app" https://project-flow-hyas.onrender.com/api/health
```

Both should return successful responses.

---

**Expected Result**: After the deployment completes (2-3 minutes), mobile login should work without the "Network error" message.
