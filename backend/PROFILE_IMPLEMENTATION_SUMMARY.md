## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. Profile Management
- ✅ **Get Current Profile** - Retrieve user's own profile information
- ✅ **Update Profile** - Update personal details, contact info, and role-specific fields
- ✅ **Role-based Field Updates** - Different fields for PM, Employee, and Customer
- ✅ **Input Validation** - Comprehensive validation for all profile fields

### 2. Profile Image Management
- ✅ **Image Upload** - Upload profile images using Cloudinary
- ✅ **Image Optimization** - Automatic resizing to 400x400px with face detection
- ✅ **Image Deletion** - Remove profile images from both database and Cloudinary
- ✅ **File Validation** - Support for JPEG, PNG, WebP with 5MB size limit
- ✅ **Cloud Storage** - Organized storage structure in Cloudinary

### 3. Password Management
- ✅ **Change Password** - Secure password change with current password verification
- ✅ **Password Validation** - Minimum length and confirmation matching
- ✅ **Security** - Passwords are hashed using bcrypt

### 4. User Management (PM Only)
- ✅ **View Any User Profile** - PMs can view profiles of all users
- ✅ **Update Any User Profile** - PMs can update other users' profiles
- ✅ **Role Management** - PMs can change user roles and status

### 5. Security & Authorization
- ✅ **JWT Authentication** - All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- ✅ **Role-based Access Control** - Different permissions for each user type
- ✅ **Input Sanitization** - All inputs are validated and sanitized
- ✅ **File Upload Security** - Only image files allowed with size limits

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Current User Profile Routes
```
GET    /api/profile              - Get current profile
PUT    /api/profile              - Update current profile
POST   /api/profile/image        - Upload profile image
DELETE /api/profile/image        - Delete profile image
PUT    /api/profile/password     - Change password
```

### PM-Only User Management Routes
```
GET    /api/profile/:id          - Get user profile by ID
PUT    /api/profile/:id          - Update user profile by ID
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Scripts Available:
```bash
# Setup test users
npm run setup-profile-tests

# Run comprehensive tests
npm run test-profile

# Demo the API functionality
npm run demo-profile

# Cleanup test users
npm run cleanup-profile-tests
```

### Test Coverage:
- ✅ Profile retrieval for all user types
- ✅ Profile updates for all user types
- ✅ Profile image upload/delete
- ✅ Password changes
- ✅ PM user management features
- ✅ Unauthorized access prevention
- ✅ Error handling and validation

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

The backend is fully compatible with the existing frontend profile pages:

### PM Profile (`PM-Profile.jsx`)
- ✅ Profile information display and editing
- ✅ Profile image upload functionality
- ✅ Password change functionality

### Employee Profile (`EmployeeProfile.jsx`)
- ✅ Profile information display and editing
- ✅ Profile image upload functionality
- ✅ Password change functionality
- ✅ Read-only fields for role, department, etc.

### Customer Profile (`CustomerProfile.jsx`)
- ✅ Profile information display and editing
- ✅ Profile image upload functionality
- ✅ Password change functionality
- ✅ Company and address fields

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for all endpoints
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control (PM, Employee, Customer)
3. **File Upload Security**: Only image files, size limits, Cloudinary processing
4. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all inputs
5. **Password Security**: bcrypt hashing with salt rounds
6. **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without sensitive data exposure

## 📊 Database Schema Updates

### User Model Enhancements:
```javascript
profileImage: {
  url: String,           // Cloudinary URL
  cloudinaryId: String,  // Cloudinary public ID
  uploadedAt: Date       // Upload timestamp
}
```

## 🌐 Cloudinary Integration

### Configuration:
- ✅ Automatic image optimization
- ✅ Face detection and cropping
- ✅ Quality optimization
- ✅ CDN delivery
- ✅ Organized folder structure: `projectflow/profile-images/{userId}/`

### Supported Formats:
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- WebP (.webp)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup
```env
# Add to your .env file
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloudinary-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-cloudinary-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-cloudinary-api-secret
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Test Users
```bash
npm run setup-profile-tests
```

### 4. Run Tests

npm run test-profile
```

### 5. Demo the API
```bash
npm run demo-profile
```

## 📈 Performance Considerations

1. **Image Optimization**: Automatic resizing and compression
2. **CDN Delivery**: Cloudinary CDN for fast image loading
3. **Database Indexing**: Proper indexes on user fields
4. **File Size Limits**: 5MB limit for profile images
5. **Error Handling**: Efficient error responses
